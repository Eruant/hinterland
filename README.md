A card game about survival

## Basic premise

- You must stay alive
- You must reach the civilisation

## Game features

- Energy points (if you drop to zero, you die)
- Kit cards (all the equiptment you are currently carrying)
- Scenarios (at random points in the game you have to deal with a crisis)

## Details

### Engery points

To stay alive, you need energy. You can recover energy by consuming food from the kit you are carrying ([see kit cards](#kit-cards)). You will loose energy over time, or if you fall into difficulty ([see scenarios](#scenarios)).

### Kit cards

Kit cards are the items you are currently carrying with you. This can include food, equiptment or other tools you may need to survive.

You only have so many hands, so picking and choosing what to take and what to leave behind will be crucial. If you're lucky you will find a bag which will enable you to carry more.

### Scenarios

Overtime you will encounter a number of challenging tests. These will involve crossing rivers and dealing with forrest fires. You will more than likely suffer a loss of equiptment, so you need to be prepared.
